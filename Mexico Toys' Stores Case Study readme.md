## [Project 8: Mexico Toy Stores Case Study](https://github.com/Shajar87/Project_Portfolio/blob/main/Mexico%20Toys'%20Stores%20Case%20Study.pdf)
### About The Project
**Tool used: pgAdmin**

In this project "Mexico Toy Stores Case Study", I used SQL queries to answer some of the fascinating questions about the sales of toy stores.
Used some of the common and advanced SQL concepts such as joins, window functions, CTE, subqueries, and more to answer the questions below:


1.	What are the top 5 selling products?
2.	What are the sales trends for each product?
3.	Which products have consistently increased sales for the last three consecutive months?
4.	Find the products which are contributing approximately 50% to the total revenue from all the products.
5.	What is the inventory turnover rate for each product?
