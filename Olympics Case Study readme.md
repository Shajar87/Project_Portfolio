## Project: 120 Years of Olympic History Analysis Using SQL
### About The Project
**Tool used: MySQL**

In this project **"120 years of Olympic history"**, I used SQL queries to answer some fascinating questions about the Olympic games.
The dataset contains historical data of the modern Olympic Games, from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual event, including the athlete's name, sex, age, height, weight, country, and medal, and the event's name, sport, games, year, and city.

| ID | Name                | Sex | Age | Height | Weight | Team   | NOC | Games         | Year | Season | City       | Sport     | Event                            | Medal |

This case study provides an opportunity to know about the Olympics e.g. how the Olympics have evolved, including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.

Used some of the common to advanced SQL concepts such as **joins, window functions, CTE, subqueries**, and more to answer the questions below:

1. How many Olympic games have been held?
2. List down all Olympics games held so far.
3. Mention the total no of nations who participated in each Olympics game.
4. Which year saw the highest and lowest no of countries participating in the Olympics?
5. Identify the sport which was played in all summer Olympics.
6. Fetch details of the oldest athletes to win a gold medal.
7. Find the Ratio of male and female athletes who participated in all Olympic games.
8. Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze).
9. Fetch the top 5 most successful countries in the Olympics.
10. List down the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country corresponding to each Olympic game.
11. Identify which country won the most gold, silver, and bronze medals and the most medals in each Olympic game.
