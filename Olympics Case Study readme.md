## Project: 120 Years of Olympic History Analysis Using SQL
### About The Project
**Tool used: MySQL**

In this project **"120 years of Olympic history"**, I used SQL queries to answer some fascinating questions about the Olympic games.
The dataset contains historical data of the modern Olympic Games, from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual event, including the athlete's name, sex, age, height, weight, country, and medal, and the event's name, sport, games, year, and city.

1. How many Olympic games have been held?
2. List down all Olympics games held so far.
3. Mention the total no of nations who participated in each Olympics game.
4. Which year saw the highest and lowest no of countries participating in the Olympics?
