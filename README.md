### About The Project
**In this project "120 years of Olympic history",I used SQL queries to answer some fascinating questions about the games.**

**Used some of the common and advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, CTEs, subqueries, and more to answer the queations as below:

1. How many Olympic games have been held?
2. List down all Olympics games held so far.
3. Mention the total no of nations who participated in each Olympics game.
4. Which year saw the highest and lowest no of countries participating in the Olympics?
5. Identify the sport which was played in all summer Olympics.
6. Fetch details of the oldest athletes to win a gold medal.
7. Find the Ratio of male and female athletes who participated in all Olympic games.
8. Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze).
9. Fetch the top 5 most successful countries in the olympics.
10. List down the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country corresponding to each Olympic game.
11. Identify which country won the most gold, silver, and bronze medals and the most medals in each Olympic game.
12. Which countries have never won gold medals but have won silver/bronze medals?
13. Break down all Olympic games where India won a medal in Hockey and how many medals in each Olympic game.
## [Project 2: Data Professional Survey Breakdown](https://github.com/Shajar87/Project_Portfolio/blob/main/BI%20Project%201.pbix)
**This is a Power BI dashboard for the data professionals' survey data taken from the internet.**

In this project, I used the data from a survey of data professionals available on the internet.

Firstly, the data was loaded and transformed in Power BI.
Then I used some of the DAX functions to create this dashboard.
**Some of the key findings are:**
The most commonly used programming languages among data professionals are Python, SQL, and R.
Data professionals on average earn a high salary, with an average salary of around $60k per year.
The Average Salary of Data scientists is greater than the other data profiles, etc.
