### About The Project
**Tool used: Python**

In this project, the goal was to predict the sales of stores located in the USA with the help of machine learning techniques e.g. 

The dataset used here provides data on Sales Values in Dollars of American stores from 2010 to 2011.

**The steps involved were as:**
1. Cleaned data e.g.
- Changed the date datatype and format.
- Dropped some irrelevant columns.
- Encoding of categorical features.
2. Building Machine learning model using the machine-learning technique (Random Forest Regressor.
